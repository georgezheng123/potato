In a school where artistic abilities are not seen as priority, you can easily find your niche as an artist for the Spectator, where your art will be displayed for all of its readers to admire. The limits of your creativity have no bounds; you can flaunt your skills in thematic spreads, comics, or Caption Contest illustrations! We encourage the use of all media!",

We're a very fun, creative department, but we also deal with hardcore investigative journalism that can actually effect change and shock people!

After all, no one wants to read ugly and confusing blocks of text. With creativity and a certain magic called the InDesign, we present to you what you know as the Spectator.
