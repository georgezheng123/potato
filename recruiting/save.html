						<section id="section-flip-2">The humor department is The Spectator’s Onion, not edible but still in print. We’re the only department that can get away with printing libel and slander, as we’re allowed to make up quotes, events, and other facts. In fact, there is only one requirement for articles: they have to be funny.<br><br>Staffers will be expected to contribute to the humor brainstorm on a regular basis and write an article on occasion when they feel like it.<br><br><a href=http://goo.gl/forms/TZX17qfSHH>Apply to Humor here!</a></section>
						<section id="section-flip-3">The Spectator art department brings the paper to life with beautiful, creative, and/or witty pieces to complement articles. We also love comics and have an ongoing comics section in the paper! We welcome everyone who likes to draw or simply doodle, who considers themselves creative, or would like to be a part of the awesome department and showcase work in the newspaper. You'll meet so many other creative artists just like you!<br><br>A staff member must draw for at least one article every two issues, or one and a half months. Not much to ask. We may ask for two pieces per two issues. A member must also attend all meetings unless a valid excuse is given.<br><br><a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DKWRN-IRlDBT4A8RRf_ESHwtlE_HMKQOXlES1HUxXPc/viewform?edit_requested=true>Apply to Art here!</a></section>
						<section id="section-flip-4">The Business Department is responsible for raising 100% of the funds necessary to uphold the production of The Spectator. We receive no money from Stuyvesant and take pride in being financially independent from the school. Not only do our staff members get the opportunity to raise tens of thousands of dollars singlehandedly through the selling of advertisements, they learn valuable and applicable skills in the process. Our department helps you hone your networking, communication, and negotiation skills and trains you to think logistically and professionally. We are the only department of The Spectator that allows you to work with people outside of Stuyvesant, so this means you'll be out there in the real business world, making real money, as a high school student. Not many people get this shot. Think about the feeling you'll get when you secure one of many, huge, $4000 deals, knowing it doesn't only better our department, but the entire paper and its legacy. It's pretty great.<br><br>The Business Department is a flexible one. Work entails contacting businesses to sell advertisements via phone, email or in person and this can be done at home and on your own schedule. Although our meetings are much more spaced out than those of other departments, we host work sessions after school a few times a month, after our initial training sessions, for you sit in a professional environment and make business calls and write solicitation emails. We will be training you to be a professional salesperson, and the skills we teach you will no doubt carry you into endeavors that extend far beyond The Spectator.<br><br><a href=https://stuyspec.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk06wcb>Apply to Business here!</a></section>
						<section id="section-flip-5">We edit the whole paper for grammatical errors! This department is great if you want to join the paper but don't necessarily want to join a writing department.  If you edit the essays of your friends or think you would enjoy doing so, this is the department for you! It is also a great department to join if you like reading, as reading articles is a huge part of the job!</br><br>You will be expected to edit at minimum two articles per issue. There is a strike system in place and you will receive strikes if you do not fulfill this requirement. This will involve you throughly checking for grammatical mistakes and frequently referencing the Stuyle Guide. An interest in the articles the Spectator publishes would also be great, as that will make editing them a lot more fun!<br><br><a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1aSA97igNHFA5qkkJrqttjkcUCiIiqhD7hcEei8IYwr8/viewform?usp=send_form>Apply to Copy here!</a></section>
						<section id="section-flip-6">The best way to describe Features in one word is STORYTELLING. This is our main, essential craft. We write profiles telling the stories of interesting people or communities at Stuyvesant, provide more information and delve deeper into issues that News has covered, uncover information about specific issues at Stuy, and more. We're a very fun, creative department, but we also deal with hardcore investigative journalism that can actually effect change and shock people! So if you love stories and want to write some hard-hitting articles, Features is the place for you.<br><br>Staffers are expected to be capable of basic grammar and spelling rules, able to write nice, coherent sentences (thought we'll teach you how to write even more nicely!), attend our biweekly meetings, hand in articles on time, and be comfortable with interviewing students, alumni, or faculty. Staffers are also expected to genuinely like and care about writing features articles. <br><br><a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Hx10FsWVeJSCDrJn6J-BSWARAgiPfV5_950Z8htyWfY/edit>Apply to Features here!</a></section>
						<section id="section-flip-7">The Arts and Entertainment section of the Spectator is responsible for covering all events pertaining to the visual and performative arts, both in and out of Stuyvesant. This includes reviews of new albums, new movies, new shows, etc., as well as "thinkpieces" on cultural happenings across the city. Each issue features an events calendar describing different things happening around the city, as well as a playlist of music for our readers and a crossword puzzle.<br><br>Every member of the department will be required to write an article every other issue, and occasionally more if ideas are scarce. Additionally,  all writers will be expected to contribute to the events calendar and the playlist for each issue. Our department will have a meeting every other week, and all writers will be expected to make it to each meeting.<br><br><a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1a3iBDa6-80vO6OgH-K5-e6EyQtEd_yU5UanANuDuczk/edit?ts=56b7fa28>Apply to A&E here!</a>

						<section id="section-flip-8">A good publication should interest readers before they even pick it up and read it; the Layout department does just that! We are the last department that works with the newspaper and are responsible for formatting all of the articles, photos, art, etc. We make sure that the paper is aesthetically appealing and easy to read. After all, no one wants to read ugly and confusing blocks of text. With creativity and a certain magic called the InDesign, we present to you what you know as the Spectator.<br><br>As a staff member, you will be asked to critique the formatting of each issue as it is released. <br><br><a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/16I2r7f3Swiq4qFecrKuUdNqH8dQHUoEOuyoHvBcaLF0>Apply to Layout here!</a></section>
						<section id="section-flip-9">News covers all the latest happenings at Stuy from new school policies to visiting speakers to cheating scandals. Newswriters learn how to cover pieces ranging from breaking news to long term investigations. Writers will have the opportunity to interview students, teachers, and administrators to gather information for objective news pieces—and sometimes even get their byline on the front page!<br><br>Staffers will taught everything they need to know about news writing and interviewing at weekly Monday meetings after school. They will be encouraged to participate in meetings and share their thoughts on the progress of the department, as well as critique the paper. Staffers must write a minimum of three articles per semester, but are welcome to write more.<br><br><a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Tvb2bN0Rxi4L23vy_ZxvoA8TACrJmMYcfcTKMgcZPBU/viewform>Apply to News here!</a></section>
						<section id="section-flip-10">Opinions is the Op-Ed department of The Spectator! This means that we are extremely passionate, well informed about contemporary issues, and capable of forming strong persuasive arguments about our beliefs. This is the department for people who want to learn how to base their idealism in fact, and how to fight for the things they care about with words.<br><br>We expect you to come to meetings roughly every week to debate important topics in the news, around school and in the media. We also expect you to keep informed about world events by reading at least one legitimate news source per day, and ideally by supplementing that news source with other reading material. In addition, our department is run primarily online, so you will be required to respond to and generate online discussion about issues you find relevant to the broader Stuyvesant community at least twice a month. If we ask you to write an article, you will be required to do so.<br><br><a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19AmjLXhZHxMxqscdW9I8aynBDvkQfUZ3uZ9VdQ-6zzk/viewform>Apply to Opinions here!</a></section>
						<section id="section-flip-11">Photo is dedicated to providing interesting and dynamic photographs to support the articles in the Spectator. Our photographers take portraits of students and teachers, photos at school events, and pictures of fun things around he city as well. Along with taking photos to accompany articles in the spectator, the photo department also contributes photo essays to the paper. <br><br>Our photographers are expected to take at least a few photos every month. They also help the department come up with ideas for and create photo essays. Being a part of the photo department is great for those of us looking for a really cool but low commitment department. Photo only has a few meeting each term and photographers take photos on their own time, as long as they are in by our deadlines.<br><br><a href=http://goo.gl/forms/WCDgolKv4g>Apply to Photo here!</a></section>
						<section id="section-flip-12">Sports is a great department for those who love any or every aspect of sports and sports culture! The majority of our coverage focuses on own sports teams and tracking their progress through the season, but we also write on professional sports and sports issues! We are a group of people who love talking, writing, and following sports.<br><br>Staffers will commit to at least one team throughout the year, which they will follow and cover at least once. We hope they will take on multiple teams, or write about their other interests, like sports culture, professional sports, or any sort of opinion they have on sports. They're expected to come to our meetings, which will be at the most bi-weekly basis, and to contribute to the department in a positive manner.<br><br><a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14zd8RGbwJUCFbrgb7ScIR4dfFPKfb8sF-oHS7a0ksrA/viewform?usp=send_form>Apply to Sports here!</a></section>
